{{ packagename }} provides standard classes and methods to work with social contact matrices in R.

This is an attempt at providing a common framework for social contact data in R, to facilitate interoperability between different data sources and analysis tools.

It results from the collaboration between multiple stakeholders:

- the ['Social Contact Data' Zenodo community maintainers and curators](https://zenodo.org/communities/social_contact_data/)
- the [conmat R package](https://idem-lab.github.io/conmat/) maintainers
- the [contactdata R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=contactdata) maintainers
- the [socialmixr R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=socialmixr) maintainers
